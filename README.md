📋 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect diseases in tomato plant leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the model identifies common diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Leaf Mold to assist farmers and agriculturalists in taking timely actions.

🚀 Features
Image-based disease detection for tomato leaves
Pre-trained or custom model for predictions
User-friendly interface (if using web or mobile apps)
Dataset used: Kaggle Plant Village Dataset (or your specific source)
Real-time predictions (if deployed using Flask, Streamlit, or other frameworks)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
